To make work, you will need feh, urxvt, i3-gaps and pywal

.Xdefaults goes in your $HOME

config goes in ~/.config/i3/

i3status.conf goes in /etc/

also you probably want to download and install wal.vim colorscheme for pywal vim colours
and to change your wallpaper edit the line at the top of the i3 config to the location of your prefered wallpaper
